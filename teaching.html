            <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve been drawn to teaching—not just the idea of sharing knowledge, but the chance to connect with people and help them discover what they’re capable of. The more I grow as an educator, the more I realise teaching is about so much more than skills or grades. It’s about building relationships, creating safe and inclusive spaces, and giving students the tools to learn and grow on their own.</p>
            <p>I believe every student can succeed if they’re given the right opportunities, and part of my role is to get to know who they are—their interests, their strengths, their challenges—and use that to help them connect to the material. I want students to see themselves in the work we do, whether that’s through projects that reflect their lives, creative expression, or tackling real-world problems that matter to them. </p>
            <p>In my classes, whether I’m teaching tech mandatory, food tech, industrial tech or design & tech. I try to make learning hands on, iterative, and flexible. Mistakes aren’t failures; they’re part of the process. What matters is that students gain confidence as creators and problem solvers. Like Noam Chomsky once said, “Education is really aimed at helping students get to the point where they can learn on their own.” That’s what I want for my students: to leave knowing they can keep growing, questioning, and building long after the class ends.</p>

                </div>
            <p>At the same time, I know I’m always learning too,through research, industry collaboration, and, most importantly, from my students. Nothing ever goes exactly as planned, and that’s okay. The best moments in teaching often come from adapting, listening, and being open to where curiosity takes us.</p>
            <p>For me, teaching is about care. It’s about showing students that they belong, that their voices matter, and that they can make a difference. Like John C. Maxwell said, “Students don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” I want every student to leave my classroom not just with knowledge, but with curiosity, purpose, and the belief that they have something meaningful to contribute to the world.</p>

            <p>Rita Pierson reminds me why I want to become a teacher: kids don’t just need lessons, they need champions. Teaching isn’t just about content - it’s about connection.</p>
