                    <p> Hi! I'm <em> Esprit Brown, </em></p>
                    <p>A third-year student teacher at Australian Catholic University. I’m passionate about creating a classroom environment where every student feels empowered to succeed and thrive. I’m currently undertaking a double degree in a Bachelor of Education (Secondary) and a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Design Innovation and Technologies.</p>
                    <p>So far, I’ve completed one of four teaching placements, which took place in a government school within the Sutherland Shire. During this placement, I delivered lessons designed to engage a diverse range of learners by incorporating a variety of teaching strategies.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my university studies and practicum experiences, I’ve developed units of work and lesson plans that have supported my growth as an educator. These plans have helped me deliver structured, well-paced lessons that promote student engagement and enhance learning outcomes.</p>
